depository for random scripts and other junk.

eureka moment after recent push: transfer scripts to web ec2 box, purge sql activity, and have the ajax trigger compilation and execution...but the design decision to put it into a database was to permit MILLIONS of users from operating the same script without worry of collision. 

plan: transfer files to ec2 web box and decide which route is the best/laziest route...to push forward with the sql implementation or to push with the brainfart eureka thought.
